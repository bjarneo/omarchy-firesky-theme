# Firesky

Firesky is a simple, elegant, and dark theme for Omarchy inspired by the dramatic contrast of a silhouetted landscape against a fire-lit sky. It's designed for those moments of deep focus, when the world fades away and all that's left is you and your code.

> In twilight's embrace, where embers glow,
> Against the void, the warm lights flow.
> Each line of code, a spark of thought,
> In firesky's realm, where dreams are wrought,
> And peaceful focus comes to grow.
